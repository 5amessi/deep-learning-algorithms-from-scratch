# AutoEncoder

An Autoencoder is a Neural Network model whose goal is to predict the input itself, typically through a “bottleneck” somewhere in the network. By introducing a bottleneck, we force the network to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the input, effectively compressing the input into a good representation. Autoencoders are related to PCA and other dimensionality reduction techniques, but can learn more complex mappings due to their nonlinear nature. A wide range of autoencoder architectures exist, including Denoising Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders, or Sequence Autoencoders.

## Problem Definition  

it's very easy problem just the input is like the output and train your data in it

you should know well how to choose your activation function and how to implement feed forward and back propagation and prevent vanishing.

you have the solution to this problem by Tensor Flow just implement it with Numpy 

Note: in tensorflow solution I use RMSprop to train dataset in numpy implement Gradient descent and know by your self how to prevent vanishing
